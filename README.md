## About The Project

This project was built to bring fundamental graph traversal algorithms to life. It provides an interactive and intuitive way to understand how different algorithms navigate a grid to find the shortest path from a start to a target node. Users can draw walls, generate complex mazes, and compare the performance of various algorithms in real-time.

This project demonstrates a solid understanding of core computer science concepts, data structures, and front-end development with a modern tech stack.

## Key Features

* **Interactive Grid:** Click and drag to draw walls, creating custom obstacles for the algorithms to navigate.
* **Draggable Nodes:** Easily move the start (green) and target (red) nodes to any position on the grid.
* **Multiple Algorithm Visualizations:** Select and visualize a variety of classic pathfinding algorithms.
* **Advanced Maze Generation:**
    * **Recursive Division:** Generates complex, structured mazes with long corridors and distinct rooms.
    * **Random Walls:** Creates a scattered, random field of obstacles.
* **Performance Analysis:** After each visualization, key metrics are displayed to allow for direct comparison of algorithm efficiency:
    * Path Length
    * Number of Nodes Visited
    * Execution Time (in milliseconds)
* **Clean & Responsive UI:** Built with a modern design that works seamlessly on all screen sizes.

## Algorithms Implemented

This visualizer showcases four fundamental pathfinding algorithms, each with its unique approach to solving the maze.

| Algorithm      | Guarantees Shortest Path | Description                                                                                             |
| :------------- | :----------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Dijkstra's** | **Yes** | The classic weighted algorithm; explores outwards from the start, guaranteeing the shortest path.         |
| **A\* Search** | **Yes** | An optimized version of Dijkstra's that uses a heuristic to intelligently guide its search toward the target. |
| **BFS** | **Yes (Unweighted)** | Explores all neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.    |
| **DFS** | **No** | Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, finding a path but not necessarily the shortest one. |
